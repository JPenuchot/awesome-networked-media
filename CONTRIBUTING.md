# Contribution Guidelines
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make a separate pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `- [LIBRARY](LINK) - Description (optional. Must be very short!)`
- Indicate if it is OS specific
- If there are very helpful resources you'd like to link, that are not part of the original linked source, list them under the entry as a one word description link
- Please ensure entries are in alphabetical order.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome.
